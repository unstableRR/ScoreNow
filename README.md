# ScoreNow (Cricket Live)
This is a simple springboot application named ScoreNow which fetches live cricket score and stores it in database and we can fetch that data later. Also, it can fetch the point table of World Cup 2023 and the point
table of Ranjhi trophy of 2023-24.
<br>
It uses web-scrapping using Jsoup dependency and here we use crickbuzz website to fetch the live scores into our application, Spring Boot to make Apis and MySql database for storing data. This is the backend of the application.
<br>
We can test the APIs on postman.
